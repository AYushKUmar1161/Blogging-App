## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install backend dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`
3. Install frontend dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with your MongoDB connection string
5. Start the backend server: `npm run dev`
6. Start the frontend: `npm start`



### What was the hardest part of this assignment?

The most challenging aspect was implementing the comment feature with proper state management in React. Ensuring that new comments were immediately reflected in the UI without requiring a full page refresh required careful handling of component state and API calls.

### How did you debug an error?

I used a combination of console logging, React Developer Tools, and network inspection in the browser's DevTools. For backend errors, I implemented proper error handling middleware and checked the server logs.

### What would you improve if you had more time?

With more time, I would:
1. Add user authentication and authorization
2. Implement post editing and deletion
3. Add rich text editing for post content
4. Implement pagination for posts and comments
5. Add image upload functionality
6. Implement search and filtering options
7. Add unit and integration tests
